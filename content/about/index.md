I'm an analytical sort who's curious about everything. I'm a solid asset on trivia teams. I currently live 
in Colorado with my wife and cat. I'm temperamentally indoorsy, but I make an effort to take hikes
when the sun isn't too high. I am constantly reading.

I work for [Clarivate](https://clarivate.com/) doing backend software development mainly on the 
[JVM](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Java_virtual_machine). Most of the codebase is [Java](https://www.java.com/),
though I use [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) where I can. We target [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for most 
of our services, though plenty still live on-premises. I use [Python](https://www.python.org/) for scripts,
automation, and small projects.

I use [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) for my home machines as it's a fine, well-supported Linux distribution.
My youthful adventures with trendier distributions were entertaining and educational, but I favor a platform
that I don't need to think about, these days.

Most of my home projects start in Python (e.g. [Spotcrates](@/projects/spotcrates/index.md)) and may move to 
the JVM for heavier work. I'm starting to investigate [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as it seems to
be maturing as a choice for efficient, performant software. I'd held off pursuing it as I'd chased many
early-stage languages and frameworks that turn out to be short-lived.

### About This Page

As part of my interest in Rust, I've decided to give [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) a try for static 
site generation. It's mainly [Markdown](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Markdown) with no need for any Rust
coding on my part, but it is a 
[supported tool](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-zola-site/) for
building and deploying to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), so I'm giving it a try.
Thanks to [Justin Tennant](https://justintennant.me/) for creating the 
[Papaya Zola theme](https://justintennant.me/projects/papaya/), thus saving me from the pain of 
creating my own website layout.
