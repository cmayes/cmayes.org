I've lost count of the times I've started writing a blog, and here I'm giving it
yet another try. I see a building backlash against commercial social platforms
and I heartily approve and agree.

My latest impulse to blog was a cascade kicked off by Google's announcement that they were 
[shutting down Domains and selling off the assets to Squarespace](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763340/google-domains-sunset-sell-squarespace).
This led me to research alternate domain hosting providers and saw that [Cloudflare's relatively
new offering](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-cloudflare-registrar/) 
has been well-received. As I was moving [cmayes.org](https://cmayes.org/), I noticed
that Cloudflare had a [free static site hosting service offering named Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

Pages seems promising. I like that they have a fairly straightforward build and deployment pipeline
that can pull from my Github project. I'm always a little suspicious of free things from for-profit
enterprises, but I can see how their cost would be negligible given the scale of their infrastructure.
It's also pretty trivial to deploy this site on any other static-page server.

I've lost track of the many attempts I've made at writing a blog. In college, I had a 
[DiaryLand](https://diaryland.com/) account. Glad to see it's still a going concern! I lost my credentials
decades ago. I self-published a [Blosxom](https://blosxom.sourceforge.net/) blog from my desktop for a while.
My [WordPress](https://cmayes.wordpress.com/) and [Tumblr](https://cmayes.tumblr.com/) accounts are still
around, last updated in 2013 and 2015 respectively. 

I think my interim public content went to [Google Plus](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Google%2B) (RIP), 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/cmayes14) (briefly), and [Discord](https://discord.com/). I still use
the last a bit. I started using [Mastodon](https://notacult.social/@cmayes) in November 2022 with
the first wave of people leaving Twitter. I plan on posting short/silly things there and using
this blog for longer-form entries.

It's time to see about actually getting this thing published. Wish me luck!
