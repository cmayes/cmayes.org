I've lost count of the times I've started writing a blog, and here I'm giving it
yet another try. I see a building backlash against commercial social platforms
and I heartily approve and agree.

My latest impulse to blog was a cascade kicked off by Google's announcement
that they were 
[shutting down Domains and selling off the assets to Squarespace](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763340/google-domains-sunset-sell-squarespace).
This led me to research alternate domain hosting providers and saw that [Cloudflare's relatively
new offering](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-cloudflare-registrar/) 
has been well-received. As I was moving [my domain](https://cmayes.org/), I noticed
that Cloudflare had a [free static site hosting service offering](https://pages.cloudflare.com).
