A Python script for managing Spotify playlists.

<!-- more -->

[Github](https://github.com/cmayes/spotcrates)

I first wrote this script to automate filtering the "Daily Mix" playlists that Spotify generates.
I've since added filtering for arbitrary lists, list randomization (Spotify's "shuffle" feature is awful),
and a filterable, sortable playlist lister.
